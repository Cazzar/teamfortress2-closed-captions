## Note to contributors
* All closecaption_*.txt files must be stored with the "UCS-2 Little Endian" character encoding
* All closecaption_*.dat files are generated from the related .txt file
* The .dat and .txt files should be committed as a pair, as they must both match and be provided to the end-user
* If you only have the .txt file, submit a pull request to the to_compile branch so it can be compiled into the game-required .dat format
