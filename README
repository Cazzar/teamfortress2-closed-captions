This project aims to provide a set of closed captions for Team Fortress 2

* All closecaption_*.txt files must be stored with the "UCS-2 Little Endian"
character encoding
* All closecaption_*.dat files are generated from the related .txt file
* The .dat and .txt files should be committed as a pair, as they must both match and be provided to the end-user
